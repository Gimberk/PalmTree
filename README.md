This challenge was to create a more functional style programming language and it largely succeeded in that goal. This was my second time making a programming language, my first one in C# using ANTLR to help learn the basics ([HolyJava](https://github.com/Gimberk/Holy-Java)), and this time I did it without those outside tools that take away all the fun!
